Nagios Contrib README
#####################

This directory contains various programs, scripts, etc. that
have been contribed by various people.  Read the source code
if you want to find who did what.

Here is a description of what you'll find...


Conversion Programs:
--------------------

- convertcfg.c is a program to quickly convert old "host" config
  files to the new template-based object config files.  It can also
  convert extended host information definitions. Type 'make convertcfg'
  to compile the utility.


Additional CGIs:
----------------

- traceroute.cgi is (surprise) a CGI that allows you to do a traceroute
  to a specific IP address.  Simply do a 'chmod +x' to make it executable
  and place it in the CGI directory (i.e. /usr/local/nagios/sbin).
  Requires Perl.

- daemonchk.c is a CGI contributed by Karl DeBisschop that can test to
  see whether or not the Nagios process is running.


Miscellaneous Goodies:
----------------------

- htaccess.sample is a *sample* .htaccess file that can be used with
  Apache to require password authentication for access to the web
  interface.

- epel-nagios.spec and epel-patches directory are added for creating EPEL like rpms

  1. Prepare your rpmbuild environment for CentOS/RHEL

  sudo yum instatll -y rpmdevtools gcc libtool rpmbuild

  sudo yum instatll -y policycoreutils-devel selinux-policy-devel \
  perl-generators gdbm-devel pyparsing systemtap perl-ExtUtils-Manifest \
  libdb perl-ExtUtils-MakeMaker  perl-ExtUtils-Install perl-devel  \
  perl-ExtUtils-ParseXS perl-local-lib  perl-CPAN perl-ExtUtils-AutoInstall \
  perl-Test-Simple perl-ExtUtils-Embed  perl-HTML-Lint

  2. Generate contrib/Makefile from contrib/Makefile.in

     ../configure      # to generate contrib/Makefile
     make rpm          # get nagioscore released tar ball
     make localsrc-rpm # tar up existing src code to create rpm

  3. To Upgrade for local EPEL RRPMs

  sudo rpm -Uvh nagios-common-4.4.5-1.el7.x86_64.rpm \
  nagios-contrib-4.4.5-1.el7.x86_64.rpm nagios-devel-4.4.5-1.el7.x86_64.rpm  nagios-4.4.5-1.el7.x86_64.rpm
  sudo systemctl daemon-reload
  sudo systemctl restart nagios

## Why Jekyll?
Jekyll is a static website generator - what it means is that in production, your site will be faster because it has been converted into HTML pages while deployment. Another reason is that by separating your landing website from your app website, your app servers get comparatively free and can boost performance for your regular customers. 

Cookie uses Tailwind 2.0 which is a good improvement over Tailwind 1.0.

## Installation
1. [Fork this repository](https://github.com/abhinavs/cookie/fork).
2. `cd cookie`
3. `bin/bootstrap`

## Starting Server
`bin/start` - development server will start at http://127.0.0.1:4061

## Customizing
1. You can customize landing page by modifying index.html in root directory.
2. You can customize other website pages by modifying files present in `_pages` directory. You can add more pages too - you will be able to directly link to them using filename. Don't forget to change Terms & Privacy Policy.
3. You can write blog posts in `_posts` directory. It's a regular Jekyll blog, and Tailwind Typography for better blog formating and code syntax highlighting is already included.
4. You should also checkout `_config.yml` in root directory, and add relevant details. Many of them are used for SEO purposes.
5. You should also add favicons in `custom-head.html` present in `_includes` directory. You can use [RealFaviconGenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/).
6. You can customize image assets in `assets/img` directory.
7. You will have to hook the 'Work with Us' form present on main page with a real backend.
8. [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) is also integrated, to add any icon in your HTML files, you can refer to the website
9. Sign up for free on [Soopr](https://www.soopr.co) and add your `publish_token` in `_config.yml` file - with this, each page gets short URL, like button and auto generated share image for social media.
